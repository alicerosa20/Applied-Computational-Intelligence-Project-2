To run correctly the code from file "proj2_soop" you must:
1.  select the number of cities you want to consider in the problem by uncommenting lines 
    (14, 15 OR 16) of the code for (20,30 OR 50) cities, respectively. (Default: 20 Cities)

2.  select the objective function to minimize by uncommenting lines (18,19,20 OR 21) for 
    the objective function (Cost Car, Cost Plane, Dist Car, Dist Plane), respectively (Default: Dist Car)

3.  To run the code with heuristic you only have to uncomment lines (116, 117 and 118) of the file (Default: No heuristic)

Note: The code will run 30 times with different seeds and plot the best solution of those
      30 runs

To run correctly the code from file "proj2_moop" you must:
1.  select the number of cities you want to consider in the problem by uncommenting lines 
    (22, 23 OR 24) of the code for (20,30 OR 50) cities, respectively. (Default: 20 cities)

Warning: Uncomment only one of the lines (from cities and objective function)
